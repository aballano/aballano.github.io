My name is Alberto Ballano, and I've been working as an Android developer since 2011 for different companies (@xing_de, former @47deg, @travelperk, @spotify) and some time as a freelancer for some popular German newspaper apps.

Apart from programming I also like gaming a lot, which ended up on getting into the gamedev world a bit with different engines such as old GameMaker, Godot and Unity. 

I like experimenting a lot and doing a lot of different small games to try out things or learn new patterns, so I'll try to post some here as well.

I've used to write more often about my experiences, learnings and failures in the past, and sometimes it can help someone else get an idea or solve a similar problem, so I'd like to continue doing so. Also, it's quite good for keeping a personal record of projects and ideas!

Hope you like the content, feel free to reach me on social media :)
